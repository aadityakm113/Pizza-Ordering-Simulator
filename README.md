# Pizza-Ordering-Simulator
A Pizza ordering simulator created with Python using Tkinter for the GUI.

I have used sqlite to create the user table. The user can choose from three different sizes and six different toppings. This is a basic project that I made and there is definitely scope for improvement.


You can find an executable file of my project called main.exe in dist/main.
